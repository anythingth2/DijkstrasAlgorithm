read weight map csv to 2d array
replace all non-connection weight to 100
edges := []
loop until edges[last Edges Index = destination index:
    find all shortest edge from each edge in edges
    sort shortest edge from each edge in edges by sum of weight of vertex was traveled
    add edge which lowest sum of weight to edges
shortestEdge := edges[last Edges Index]
